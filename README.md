# College Website

I have made a responsive web app with the help of a Youtube Tutorial.

## Tech Stack 

HTML and CSS

## What it contains ?

- Home Page
- About Page
- Course Page
- Blog Page
- Contact Page

## How does it work ? 

All the pages are linked to each other via a navigation bar. Click on these to naviagate from one page to another.
